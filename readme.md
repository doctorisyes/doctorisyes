**My Current Focus**

I am Co-Founder of the West Hatch Computer Science Society, and my main focus is helping the society fuffill its ambitions!

**My Skills**

My main programming language is Python. I know how obvious!

**My Platform**

I use a arm64 MacOS computer. That's probably not that helpful to know, but if you need a tester from a specific platform than be my guest!
